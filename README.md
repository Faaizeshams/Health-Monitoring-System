# Health-Monitoring-System
The health monitoring system uses an Arduino to track body temperature and heart rate, displaying the data on a 20x4 LCD screen. It features a temperature sensor (LM35 or DS18B20) and a heartbeat sensor (Pulse Sensor or KY-039), with a push button to start or stop the monitoring process.
